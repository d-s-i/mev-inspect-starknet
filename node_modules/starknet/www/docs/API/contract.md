# Contract

Contracts can do data transformations in JavaScript based on an ABI. They can also call and invoke to StarkNet through a provided Signer.

Contracts allow you to transform Cairo values, like `Uint256` to `BigNumber`. It could also allow users to pass their own transformers, similar to `JSON.parse`.

## Contract Factory

Contract Factory allow you to deploy contracts onto StarkNet
