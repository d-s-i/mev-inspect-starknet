# Account

An Account extends <ins>[`Provider`](/docs/API/provider)</ins> and inherits all of its methods.

It also introduces new methods that allow Accounts to create and verify signatures with a custom <ins>[`Signer`](/docs/API/signer)</ins>.

This API is the primary way to interact with an account contract on StarkNet.
